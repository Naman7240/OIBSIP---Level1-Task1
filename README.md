Task-1 Landing Page Using HTML &amp; CSS

Hey Guys!
I'm thrilled to announce that i have been selected for the web and designing internship at Oasis Infobyte. 

During this internship, I have been assigned three tasks related to web development.
This repository is for task-1, which involves creating a Landing page using HTML & CSS.
I have developed a Landing Page for 'Fusion Restro Cafe' as part of this task. 

I hope you like the work! More tasks are coming up!
